# Albreakdo

My program is a brick-break style game that teaches the user important fundamental concepts in the field of environmental science relating to albedo and climate change.

### In Development

> kivy installation: 'conda install kivy -c conda-forge' -- otherwise see instructions at https://kivy.org/doc/stable/gettingstarted/installation.html
> git clone https://github.com/lili4127/AlbreakdoGame.git
> cd ./Albreakdo/src
> python main.py (for now. once game is completed it will be deployed, downloaded, and run so no pip install)
